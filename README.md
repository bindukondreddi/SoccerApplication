Abstract
Testing plays a significant role in the software development cycle because it helps to improve the reliability, dependability and quality of software by detecting unexpected bugs or errors in it. In an era of highly interactive and responsive software processes where many organizations are using some form of agile methodology, automated testing is frequently becoming a requirement for web based projects. Automated testing means using a software tool to run repeatable tests against the application to be tested. Through automated testing we can save both money and time with less manual intervention. Main objective of the project is to understand & evaluate features of three different web browser Automated testing tools available in the market. A shopping cart web application has been created which supports registration, login, add to cart and logout functionalities. The evaluation has been done by testing those functionalities using three different automated testing tools Selenium, CasperJs, and Sahi and comparing them with each other.

Chapter 1: Introduction
Main objective of the project is to understand and evaluate features of different web browser automated testing tools available in the market. Selenium, CasperJs and Sahi Automated testing tools have been chosen for evaluation. A shopping cart web application has been created for above three automated testing tools evaluation. Shopping cart application supports registration, login and add cart functionalities. Test scripts have been created in Selenium, CasperJs and Sahi tools to support automated testing of shopping cart application and evaluation.
1.1: Why automated testing?
In todayÂ´s world, it is a challenge for any company to continuously maintain and improve the quality and efficiency of software systems development. In an era of highly interactive and responsive software processes where many organizations are using some form of agile methodology, automated testing is frequently becoming a requirement for web based projects. The main objective of Automated testing is to simplify as much of the testing effort as possible with a minimum set of scripts. Automated testing scripts can run fast and frequent, which is cost-effective for software products with a long maintenance life. When testing in an agile environment, the ability to quickly react to ever-changing software systems and requirements is necessary. New test cases are generated continuously and can be added to existing automated in parallel to the development of the software itself.
1.2: Advantages of automated testing
â Reliable: eliminating human error.
â Reusable and repeatable.
â Better quality software.
â Faster execution.
â Cost reduction.
â Increased coverage.

Chapter 2: Testing Approach
2.1: Web Application
A shopping cart web application(soccer) has been created using Apache tomcat, CSS Bootstrap, CSS framework, HTML, JavaScript, PHP, Simple cart plugin, SQL. Soccer application is created to test the basic ecommerce functionalities using three automated testing tools to evaluate those tools. This application has multiple functionalities.
ï· In register functionality the user can enter his/her details and the user password has met the criteria, the user will be registered successfully and the user details will be stored in the database.
ï· In login functionality, the user will login using username and password, if the username and password matches with the database stored credentials, the user will be successfully login. The user can view the users username on the navbar which the welcome before it.
ï· After successful login, the user will be redirected to the home page, where the user can view all the clothing.
ï· In the homepage, the user can view the desired products by clicking on the category items Sportswear, Mens and Womens and clicking on brands under those category items and the products will be displayed according to the selected condition.
ï· The user can even view items through brands by clicking on the brands under brands section and the products will be displayed according to the brands.
ï· The user can even view the products according to their price range, by moving the slider to their desire price range and the products will be displayed in that price range.
ï· The user can click on the desired product add to cart functionality which automatically add that item to the users cart showing the alert i.e.., for example Arsenal Home Men's Jersey (L) was added to the cart!.
ï· The user can even click on the desired product name which directs to the product details page where the user can change the quantity of the product the user need and add product to the cart where the alert will popup, product was added to the cart!.
ï· The user will be redirected to the homepage, if the user clicks on the home logo âALL THINGS SOCCERâ
ï· The user will be redirected cart, if the user clicks on the cart option which displayed in navbar.
ï· In the cart page, the user can view all the products he/she has added to the cart. The user can increment/decrement the quantity of the desired product by clicking on the â+â/â-â sign. By clicking on remove the user can even remove the product.
ï· By clicking on the logout option on the navbar, the user can logout from the website.

This website helps to know how to locate elements, how to handle pop-up dialog windows which cannot be inspected or included in the page content, how to fill text box, how to click buttons, how to navigate pages etc..
Soccer homepage
Figure 1: Soccer homepage
This is the home page of the soccer website. In this page, the user can view the products by selecting their desired category like sportswear, mens and womens. The user can view the products by even selecting various brands like Nike, Puma, Adidas and Under Armor. The user
4
can view the products by even selecting the price range which display the products in that price range. From this page the user can navigate to the login\register page, cart page.
Register/Login functionality:
Figure 2: Register/Login
This is the login page where the user can register/login by entering their details. If the user wants to register, the user can enter his/her details, if the user matches the password criteria the user details will be stored in the database and the user is successfully registered. If the user wants to login, the user can enters the username and the password. If the username and password matches the database stored username and password, the user will successfully login.
5
Add to cart functionality:
Figure 3: Add to cart
When the user logins, the user name will be displayed on the navbar accompanied by welcome and then the username. The user can click on the desired product name, he/she will be directed to the product details page where the user can change the quantity and add the product to the cart. The alert box will appear saying the product was added to cart. The user can directly add the desired product to the cart by directly clicking add to cart button below the desired product without being redirected to the product details page and the default quantity be one.
Cart\Logout functionality:
Figure 4: Logout
6
The user can increment/decrement the quantity of the product by clicking on the plus/minus symbols. The user can even remove the product at once by clicking on remove button. The user can logout as soon as he/she finishes with shopping.
2.2: FirePath:
Note: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebug_(software)
FirePath has been used to inspect the elements using CSS selectors in CasperJs. âFirebug is a free and open-source web browser extension for Mozilla Firefox that facilitates the live debugging, editing, and monitoring of any website CSS, HTML, DOM, XHR, and JavaScriptâ. FirePath is a Firebug extension that adds a development tool to edit, inspect and generate XPath, CSS and Sizzle. CasperJs uses headless browser execution. A headless browser is a web browser without a graphical user interface. Headless browsers provide automated control of a web page in an environment similar to popular web browsers, but are executed via command line interface. Step by step execution has been clearly shown in command prompt. Screenshots can be captured during execution.
2.3: Test Automated Tools Used:
Three test automated tools have been used to test the shopping cart web application in this project.
2.3.1: CasperJs
Note: http://casperjs.org/
CasperJs is a web UI testing framework build on top of PhantomJs.âCasperJs is an open source navigation scripting & testing utility written in JavaScriptâ. It can be installed on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X platforms. In my project CasperJs has been installed on Windows platform. For installation we need to install both CasperJs and PhantomJs. The JavaScript code has been written in notepad++ and saved file using .js extension.
CasperJs finds an element with the help of CSS or XPath selectors.
2.3.2: Sahi
Sahi is a light-weight web testing tool. Sahi is an automated testing tool for web applications, with the facility to record and playback scripts. Sahi is a commercial tool. Sahi open source tool supports limited functionalities. Sahi supports Java and JavaScript.
7
Figure 5: Sahi
Note: The above figure is from https://sahipro.com/alldocs/v5.1.1/introduction/architecture.html
Sahi runs as a proxy server and the browser's proxy settings are configured to point to Sahi's proxy. The injected javascript adds event handlers for recording, adds Sahi's APIs for event simulation and mocks some window dialogs like alert, prompt, confirm, print so that playback is not affected
Sahi works on multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, Android etc. Sahi runs on multiple browsers like Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera. Sahi directly recognizes browsers represent in our system.
Sahi open in a browser we choose. To open sahi controller in a browser we need to use ALT+DoubleClick command. Sahi controller has two tabs record and playback.
In record controller, we need to enter a script name and click record button. Then click stop button after when we are done with recording steps. Sahi automatically save the script in script directory. We can even choose other Actions like wait, comments, exists etc. which we can append to the script. Sahi also has inbuilt script editor, where we can directly edit scripts and save them without the use of third party applications.
8
Sahi playback controller runs the recorded execution steps when we enter the file name and startUrl and click the play button. The step by step execution has been clearly shown in the statements block. We even have the options to view/edit the scripts.
Sahi has in-built logs which shows the Pass/Fail reports clearly.
Sahi doesnât need any tools like eclipse, notepad++ to write sahi scripts. Sahi has inbuilt script editor where we can edit scripts and save them.
2.3.3: Selenium Selenium is an open source Automated testing suite for web applications across different browsers and platforms.Selenium is a set of different software tools each with different approach to supporting automated testing like Selenium IDE, Selenium Remote Control RC, Selenium WebDriver and Selenium Grid. The standalone Selenium Server acts as a proxy between the script and the browser-specific drivers like Firefox driver, chrome driver etc.
Figure 6: Selenium Note: The image is copied from the book, Selenium Testing Tools Starter, authored by Unmesh Gundecha, PACKT publishing.
2.3.3.1: Selenium IDE
The information in the Selenium IDE section is based on information from the Selenium documentation page, available at the following location: http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/02_selenium_ide.jsp) Selenium IDE is an integrated development environment for Selenium scripts. It is a Firefox plugin and provides an easy-to-use interface for developing automated tests. Selenium IDE has a recording feature, which records user actions as they are performed and then exports them as a reusable script in one of many programming languages that can be later executed. Selenium IDE includes the entire Selenium Core, allowing to easily and quickly record and play back tests in the actual environment.
9
Figure 7: Selenium IDE
Note: http://www.slideshare.net/kjbuckley/web-application-testing-with-selenium, slide 23
To run the Selenium-IDE, we select it from the Firefox Tools menu. It opens with an empty script-editing window and a menu for loading, or creating new test cases.
âThe File menu has options for Test Case and Test Suite (suite of Test Cases). Using these you can add a new Test Case, open a Test Case, save a Test Case and export Test Case in a language of your choice. You can also open the recent Test Case.â
âThe Edit menu allows copy, paste, delete, undo, and select all operations for editing the commands in your test case. The Options menu allows the changing of settings. You can set the timeout value for certain commands, add user-defined user extensions to the base set of Selenium commands, and specify the format (language) used when saving your test cases. The Help menu is the standard Firefox Help menu; only one item on this menuâUI-Element Documentationâpertains to Selenium-IDE.â
âToolbar
The toolbar contains buttons for controlling the execution of your test cases, including a step feature for debugging your test cases. The right-most button, the one with the red-dot, is the record button.
10
Speed Control: controls how fast your test case runs.
Run All: Runs the entire test suite when a test suite with multiple test cases is loaded.
Run: Runs the currently selected test. When only a single test is loaded this button and the Run All button have the same effect.
Pause/Resume: Allows stopping and re-starting of a running test case.
Step: Allows you to âstepâ through a test case by running it one command at a time. Use for debugging test cases.
Apply Rollup Rules: This advanced feature allows repetitive sequences of Selenium commands to be grouped into a single action. Detailed documentation on rollup rules can be found in the UI-Element Documentation on the Help menu.
Record: Records the userâs browser actions.â
âTest Case Pane
âScript is displayed in the test case pane. It has two tabs, one for displaying the command and their parameters in a readable âtableâ format.
The other tab â Source, displays the test case in the native format in which the file will be stored. By default, this is HTML although it can be changed to a programming language such as Java or C#, or a scripting language like Python.â In the Options menu, we can change the programming languages in which we want the script to display. âThe Source view also allows one to edit the test case in its raw form, including copy, cut and paste operations.â
Log
âWhen you run our test case, error messages and information messages showing the progress are displayed in this pane automatically.These messages are often useful for test case
11
debugging. The Clear button for clearing the Log. The info button is a drop-down allowing selection of different levels of information to logâ.
2.3.3.2: Selenium WebDriver
Selenium 2.0 is the combination of both WebDriver and Selenium 1.0. WebDriver is a tool for automating web application testing. It aims to provide a friendly API thatâs easy to explore and understand, easier to use.
Selenium WebDriver is an open source Automated testing suite for web applications across different browsers and platforms.
Figure 8: Selenium 2.0

The above figure8: http://www.slideshare.net/humayunrana786/test-a-27965660 Slide 5
Selenium WebDriver scripts have been written in JAVA language in ECLIPSE IDE tool. A java project have been created in ECLIPSE IDE and selenium jar files have been added to external libraries.
Selenium Framework Execution Process:
Figure 9: Selenium Framework Execution Process
Note: http://www.slideshare.net/cuelogic/automation-testing-by-selenium-web-driver?next_slideshow=4 slide:51
POI.jar file is an Apache POI whose mission is to create and maintain Java APIs for manipulating various file formats. The POI.jar file has been downloaded and added to external libraries class in eclipse Java Project (Soccer). Selenium.jar file has been downloaded and added to the project Soccer to write scripts in selenium. Test Suite is the combination of multiple test cases. The controller access the Browser and URL by running test suite, which contains multiple test cases and perform multiple tests in the applications and the results will be displayed.
13
Selenium WebDriver API commands:
ï· Connecting to a web-browser: WebDriver driver= new FirefoxDriver ();
For connection to Google chrome or internet explorer, we need to download chromedriver.exe, IEDriverServer.exe file and have to set property for those .exe files.
ï· Fetching a page: driver.get(âwww.google.comâ);
ï· Locating UI elements: UI elements can be located by using id, css, xpath, className, tagName, name, linkText.
In this project we can used xpath to locate UI elements. FirePath is the tool used for locating elements xpath.
ï· Popup dialogs: We can accept the alert using
driver.switchTo().alert().accept();

Summary:
In this paper, the team wants to automate functional tests to run often in agile methodology before development. They used few open source tools like Canoo WebTest and HttpUnit but they failed to handle most instances. Then they used QuickTest Professional with record and playback features which interacts with browser but failed to adopt with changes and not suitable for scripts before development. Then they came up with selenium.
Selenium is a web testing tool with cross browser interaction. Selenium uses commands such as navigate a page, locate and click an element using identifiers like name, xpath, css etc.., or enter information in textbox, assertion commands to allow the user to compare actual and expected values and can also run test suite i.e., combination of multiple test cases and run sequentially.
Selenium tests are integrated with other automated functional tests using FitNesse. FitNesse is an automated testing tool, whose goal is to enable customers, testers, and programmers to collaboratively learn what their software should do, and to automatically compare that to what it actually does do and also keeps past versions of pages.Later selenium tests are added to the continuous integration build where CruiseControl is used. CruiseControl is a framework a for continuous build process which incorporates Ant and source control tools and allows
14
immediate feedback on the build and test status. Cobertura is a code coverage tool which calculates the percentage of code accessed by tests.
Out of all tools team as found that Selenium is the best which allows users to write their own extensions, easy to create custom actions. But selenium doesnât support downloading or uploading files, database tests or other back-end tests.

Summary:
Selenium help developers to easily run acceptance tests in their Web browsers which is an open source software available for Windows, Linux, and Macintosh.
Selenium Core run a JavaScript application in a host browser and controls Web application under test according to browserâs capabilities. For Selenium Core the commands need to be written in Selenese, Selenium Remote Control (RC) scripts can be written in many programming languages like C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
Selenium IDE record and playback tests within Firefox. Selenium Gridâs purpose is to simulate an array of multiple users for load testing, use it to break a long test into smaller parts. These parts then execute in parallel on several machines instead of in sequence, which speeds things up as it runs in the browser. Locating elements can be done by using xpath or css selectors. Actions done by selenium are fill text fields, text areas, password fields, select an option from a drop-down menu, click a button, check or uncheck a checkbox, select a radio button, or follow a link, wait until the action a page navigate or refresh, verify whether an element matches the given pattern or whether the element is present, assert which is same as verify, but terminate if verification fails which waits until an element is present. This paper discuss about selenium features.

2.4.2: Web browser connection:
ï· CasperJs supports headless browser execution.
ï· Sahi detects all the web browser in our system and display those browsers where we can choose any browser to run our scripts.
ï· Selenium IDE supports only Firefox browser
ï· In Selenium WebDriver: WebDriver driver= new FirefoxDriver ();
For connection to Google chrome or internet explorer, we need to download chromedriver.exe, IEDriverServer.exe file and have to set property for those .exe files.
2.4.3: Languages:
ï· CasperJs supports only JavaScript/CoffeeScript. If the user are not familiar with either of the scripts, they may be facing little difficulty in programming.
16
ï· Sahi Pro uses sahi script which is an extension of JavaScript language. Sahi also has driver in Java and Ruby, through which we can control the browser, but do not have features like automatic reports.
ï· Selenium supports multiple languages like Java, Ruby, Php, Perl, Python, C#, Groovy.
2.4.4: Recorder:
ï· Sahi records actions which are done in any browser and can playback later.
ï· Selenium IDE can record actions which are done in Firefox and can playback. Doesnât support any other browsers for recording option.
2.4.5: Navigation:
ï· In CasperJs, navigation to URL page is done by using start function
casper.start('http://localhost/soccer/');
ï· In Sahi, navigation to URL page is done by
_navigateTo("http://localhost/soccer/ ");
ï· In Selenium, the page fetching is done using command
driver.get('http://localhost/soccer/');
2.4.6: Wait For Element:
In some situations it takes time to load a webpage, so the element cannot be find immediately and due to late loading, the execution may get aborted in the middle as it cannot find the element. So, "wait" commands wait for some condition to become true. They will succeed immediately if the condition is already true. However, they will fail and halt the test if the condition does not become true within the current timeout setting or default timeout setting.
ï· The wait code is written by three automated tools for login button as follows.
<button class="btn btn-default" value="Log in" name="login" type="submit">Login</button>
ï· CasperJs: waitForSelector is used to wait for selected element using css selector.
casper.then(function() {
this.waitForSelector('.btn.btn-default', function() {
this.click('.btn.btn-default');
}); });
ï· Sahi: wait is used to wait for selected element.
17
_wait(_submit("btn btn-default"))
ï· Selenium : WebDriverWait is used to wait for selected element.
WebDriver d=new FirefoxDriver();
d.get("http://localhost/soccer/login.php");
WebDriverWait w= new WebDriverWait(d,10);
d.findElement(By.xpath(".//*[@id='form']/div/div/div[1]/div/form/button"));
2.4.7: Locating elements:
The tools support the following strategies for locating elements:
By id:
Select the element with the specified @id attribute.
ï· CasperJs
casper.then(function() {
casper.waitForSelector('div.login-form', function() {
this.fillSelectors('div.login-form', {
'input[id="login_input_username"]': 'sindu',
'input[id="login_input_password"]': 'sindu1',
}, true);
})
ï· Sahi
_byId("login_input_username ")
ï· Selenium
driver.findElement(By.id("login_input_username"))
By name:
ï· CasperJs
casper.then(function() {
18
casper.waitForSelector('div.login-form', function() {
this.fillSelectors('div.login-form', {
'select[name*="user_name"]': 'sindu',
'select[name*="user_password"]': 'sindu1',
}, true);
})
ï· In Sahi, the elements are located and clicked by Name
_click(_submit("login"));
The above is SahiScript, where _click , clicks on the link and _setValue, sets value to the selected textbox.
ï· Selenium
driver.findElement(By.name("login"))
Xpath:
XPath is the standard navigation tool for XML. XPath is used everywhere where there is XML. XPath is a very powerful language to express which element to identify, It can produce very reliable and low maintenance locators and can even create very brittle test cases.
Pros: Allows very precise locators Cons: Slower than CSS, Relies on browserâs XPath implementation which is not always complete (especially on IE).
Note: https://testingchronicle.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/web-driver-locators-xpath-vs-css-selectors/
Locate an element using an XPath expression.
ï· Using Xpath selector, CasperJs clicks on the login button.
casper.start('http://localhost/soccer/login.php', function() {
this.test.assertExists({
type: 'xpath',
19
path: './/*[@id='form']/div/div/div[1]/div/form/button '
}, 'the element exists');
});
ï· Using Xpath selector, Sahi Pro clicks on the Login button
_byXPath(".//*[@id='form']/div/div/div[1]/div/form/button]")
ï· In Selenium, Xpath selectors have been used to locate and click elements in the website.
Below is the code for clicking on the login button using Xpath.
driver.findElement(By.xpath(".//*[@id='form']/div/div/div[1]/div/form/button")).click();
driver.findElement, find the element within the current page by using given mechanism like xpath, css etc...
CSS Selector Syntax:
The CSS locator strategy uses CSS selectors to find the elements in the page. Selenium supports CSS 1 through 3 selectorâs syntax. Browsers implement CSS parsing engines for formatting or styling the pages using CSS syntax.
Pros:
o Much faster than Xpath
o Widely used
o Provides a good balance between structure and attributes
o Allows for selection of elements by their surrounding context
Cons: They tend to be more complex and require a steeper learning curve.
Note: https://testingchronicle.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/web-driver-locators-xpath-vs-css-selectors/
ï· In CasperJs, CSS selectors have been used to locate and click elements in the website.
casper.then(function() {
this.fill('div.login-form', {
20
user_name : 'sindu',
user_password : 'sindu1'
}, true); });
then() function basically adds a new navigation step in a stack. A step is a javascript function which can do two different things: one is waiting for the previous step - if any - being executed and other is waiting for a requested url and related page to load
ï· Sahi doesnât use CSS selectors.
Note: https://sahipro.com/docs/introduction/index.html
ï· In Selenium, CSS selectors have also been used to locate and click elements in the website.
Below is the code for clicking on the login button using CSS.
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(".btn.btn-default ")).click();
2.4.8: Pop-up dialogs:
ï· The Pop-up dialog window is an overlay positioned within the viewport and is protected from page content. They cannot be inspected. Those dialog windows were handled by different automated testing tools differently.
ï· CasperJs uses waitForAlert function to handle alerts.
casper.waitForAlert(function(response) {
this.echo("Alert received: " + response.data);
return true; });
ï· In Sahi, alerts are handled using
_lastalert()
ï· In Selenium, driver.switchTo().alert();
return true;
2.4.9: Screenshots:
ï· CasperJs captures screenshots during execution using
this.capture('item.png');
21
ï· Sahi captures it using
_takePageScreenShot();
ï· Selenium captures screenshots using
File srcFile=((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
FileUtils.copyFile(srcFile, new File(âC:item.pngâ);
2.4.10: Assertions:
ï· Assertions are like Accessors, but they verify that the state of the application conforms to what is expected.
ï· There are many types of assertions. They are:
assertEquals() :
AssertTrue() has been done for user_name in login using three automated testing tools to retrieve the assertion as true.
<input id="login_input_username" class="login_input" type="text" required="" name="user_name">
o CasperJs:
test.assertEqual((x(' .//*[@id='login_input_username']'), 'sindu' );
o Sahi:
_assertEqual("sindu", _getValue(_textbox("user_name")));
_assertEqual will do nothing if the expected and actual values match _assertEqual will log failures to the playback logs if the expected and actual values are not equal
o Selenium WebDriver:
Assert.assertEquals ("sindu", driver.findElement(By.id("login_input_username")).getAttribute("value"));
System.out.println("assert equal and script continues");
Selenium IDE doesnot support assertEqual.
assertTrue() :
22
AssertTrue() has been done for user_name in login using three automated testing tools to retrieve the assertion as true.
<input id="login_input_username" class="login_input" type="text" required="" name="user_name">
o CasperJs:
casper.test.assertTruthy((x(' .//*[@id='login_input_username']'), 'sindu' );
o Sahi:
_assertTrue(true,_textbox("user_name"));
o Selenium :
Assert.assertTrue(driver.findElement(By.id("login_input_username")).isDisplayed());
assertFalse():
AssertFalse() has been done for user_name in login using three automated testing tools to retrieve the assertion as failed as it is true.
<input id="login_input_username" class="login_input" type="text" required="" name="user_name">
o CapserJs:
casper.test. assertFalsy ((x(' .//*[@id='login_input_username']'), 'b' );
o Sahi:
_assertFalse(false,_textbox("user_name"));
_assertFalse will do nothing if the condition evaluates to false
_assertFalse will log failures to the playback logs if the condition evaluates to true.
o Selenium:
Assert.assertFalse(null, false);
Here the script doesnot fail, if the value inserted in the textbox username is not null.
Selenium IDE doesnot have assertFalse
23
assertExists:
assertExists() has been done for user_name in login using three automated testing tools to retrieve the assertion as true.
<input id="login_input_username" class="login_input" type="text" required="" name="user_name">
o CapserJs:
casper.test.assertExists(x('.//*[@id='login_input_username']'), 'the element exists');
o Sahi:
_assertExists(_textbox("user_name"));
o Selenium:
Selenium doesnot support assertExists.
assertNotEqual() :
AssertNotEqual() has been used for user_name in login using three automated testing tools, if the to retrieve the assertion as true.
<input id="login_input_username" class="login_input" type="text" required="" name="user_name">
o CapserJs:
casper.test. assertNotEquals ((x(' .//*[@id='login_input_username']'), 'b' );
o Sahi:
_assertNotEqual("b", _getValue(_textbox("user_name")));
_assertNotEqual will do nothing if the expected and actual values do not match _assertNotEqual will log failures to the playback logs if the expected and actual values are equal
o Selenium:
24
Assert.assertNotEquals ("b", driver.findElement(By.id("login_input_username")).getAttribute("value"));
System.out.println("assert not equal and script continues");
Selenium IDE doesnot support assertNotEqual.
assertVisible:
AssertVisible() has been used for user_name in login using three automated testing tools, if the textbox is visible in that page it retrieves the assertion as true.
<input id="login_input_username" class="login_input" type="text" required="" name="user_name">
o CasperJs:
casper.test.assertVisible(x(' .//*[@id='login_input_username']'));
o Sahi:
_assertVisible(_textbox("user_name"));
o Selenium: All Selenium Assertions can be used in two modes: "assert" and "verify". For example, you can "assertVisible" and "verifyVisible" . When an "assert" fails, the test is aborted. When a "verify" fails, the test will continue execution, logging the failure. This allows a single "assert" to ensure that the application is on the correct page, followed by a bunch of "verify" assertions to test form field values, labels, etc.
Code using assertVisible:
assertVisible(driver.findElement(By.id("login_input_username")));
Code using verifyVisible: The verification errors wiil be logging the failure but the test will continue execution.
try {
assertTrue(driver.findElement(By.id("login_input_username")).isDisplayed());
} catch (Error e) {
verificationErrors.append(e.toString());
}
25
assert:
Assert() has been used for user_name in login using three automated testing tools, if the to retrieve the assertion as true.
<input id="login_input_username" class="login_input" type="text" required="" name="user_name">
o CapserJs:
casper.test.assert(x('.//*[@id='login_input_username']'), âtrueâ);
o Sahi:
_assert(true,_textbox("user_name"))
_assert will do nothing if the condition passed to it is true _assert will log failures to the playback logs if the condition evaluates to false.
o Selenium: Doesnot have assert() condition.
Selenium IDE doesnât contain assertEqual, assertTrue, assertFalse, assertExists and assertNotEqual. Selenium doesnot have assert() function.
2.4.11: Mode of execution:
ï· In CasperJs, the mode of execution is done using command line prompt using command
casperjs filename.js
ï· In Sahi, the mode of execution is done using playback option, by entering the filename and start URL.
ï· In Selenium IDE, the mode of execution is done by selecting the test case and selecting the option whether to run the entire test suite or the test case.
ï· In Selenium WebDriver, the mode of execution is done by using another tools like Eclipse.
26
2.4.12: Execution:
ï· CasperJs supports headless browser execution, which means the detailed step by step execution process can be viewed in command prompt. Disadvantage of headless browser execution is it gets unmanageable if we have lot of test files.
ï· Sahi, runs directly in the browser which it saves lot of debugging effort as we can view the activities directly in the browser and the inbuilt PASS/FAIL logs are saved directly for later viewing purpose.
ï· Selenium, runs directly in the browser so, it saves lot of debugging effort as we can view the activities directly in the browser.
ï· But, the headless browser execution is much faster than browser execution when it executes multiple scripts at a time.
27
2.4.13: Selenium vs CasperJs
Selenium
CasperJs
1. Cross-browser execution.
1. Command line based headless browser execution.
2. Supports many languages.

5. Additional tools are required to run scripts. (e.g.: eclipse)
5. No additional tools required. Scripts directly run in sahi controller.
2.4.15: Evaluation Overview:
The evaluation has been done by testing same test case in web application using three automated testing tools CasperJs, Sahi and Selenium. Total nine different test cases have been created using three automated tool each contains nine test cases. Test cases have been created for register, login, add to cart, view products by sportswear brands, view products by mens brands, view products by womens brands, view products by brands, view product in desired price range, cart and logout functionalities. The comparison have been done on how easy to write the script, how many assertions have been used and whether the test case results are pass/fail by all three automated testing tools.
29

2.4.17: Conclusion for evaluation:
ï· In this evaluation section 2.4.1, we have learned the basic comparison between three automated web testing tools.
ï· From 2.4.2 we have learned how the web connection will be given in three tools for different browsers, as CasperJs supports headless browser execution there is no need to separate browser connection, sahi automatically detects all the browser in the system and display those browser and connections has to be given for selenium.
ï· From 2.4.3 we have learned which tool supports which scripting languages.
ï· From 2.4.4 we have learned about which tools supports record feature and on how many web browsers.
ï· From 2.4.5 we have learned how to navigate from one page to another web page in three tools.
ï· From 2.4.6 we have learned when and how to wait For Element in three tools as it may take time to load the webpage.
ï· From 2.4.7 we have learned, what are the various strategies three tools support for locating elements, which tool doesnât support certain strategy which are being supported by other tools and how to locate the same elements using various strategies by three tools.
ï· From 2.4.8 we have learned how to handle pop-up dialogs by three testing tools.
ï· From 2.4.9 we have learned how to capture screenshots using three testing tools.
36
ï· From 2.4.10 we have learned various types of assertions. Which tool supports which types of assertions which are not supported by another tool. If three tool support same assertions how those assertions can be written in three tools.
ï· From 2.4.11 we have learned about the mode of execution of various tools.
ï· From 2.4.12 we have learned about how the scripts are being executed in three tools.
ï· In 2.4.13 we discuss about the basic differences between Selenium and CasperJs.
ï· In 2.4.14 we discuss about the basic differences between Selenium IDE and Sahi.
ï· In 2.4.15 we discuss about how the evaluating feature of three tools helped in executing test cases in those three tools.
ï· In 2.4.16 we discuss about the various test cases and the scenario of those test cases and what features of the site and the testing tools it tests.
ï· Tools are compared by comparing the features of three automated testing tools by detailing about which tools supports what various strategies in the feature and which tool doesnât support those various strategies in the same feature and also how the feature has to be mentioned in the code is shown clearly by taking the same element for feature.
ï· CasperJs tool works better for filling login/register forms and it need one function to locate the login form and enter the details in the text box whereas in Selenium and sahi the user need to locate each text box and the keys need to be sent.
ï· When the individual is not familiar with JavaScript then the selenium tool works better for the user as it supports many scripting languages.
ï· Selenium and Sahi supports record and playback features which reduces the manual effort whereas in CasperJs the individual need to write the scripts manually.
ï· In assertions, I found that Sahi works easier as it shows the format of the specified assertion and instead of running the whole script it only runs the assertion statement and if it meets the criteria then we can append the statement to the script.
ï· In execution each tool has its own advantages and disadvantage. Selenium and Sahi execution by interacting with browser which saves the debugging effort but takes time to load the webpage and perform the entire test case whereas in CasperJs it supports headless browser execution which executes fast by viewing pass/fail test output gets unmanageable when we have lot of test files.
37
2.5: Implementation
The test scripts have been written in three automated testing tools i.e., CasperJs, Sahi, Selenium IDE and Selenium WebDriver.
2.5.1: SUCCESS TEST CASES:

Chapter 3: Conclusion
ï· Automated testing is an efficient and effective process for large web projects which saves both money and time.
ï· A web application has been tested using three automated testing tools and success and failure test cases have been found.
ï· Each automated testing tool as its own advantages and disadvantages. It depends on the individuals to choose which tool works for them well.
ï· CasperJs testing tool is useful if the individual has JavaScript knowledge.
ï· Sahi is a commercial tool, which is useful for large applications and the individuals need to have SahiScript knowledge.
ï· Through my evaluation, I found that Selenium works for every individual has it supports many programming languages and also supports record and playback features on Firefox where the scripts can be reusable and run on any browser using WebDriver.
